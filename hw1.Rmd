## Set-up
You should be viewing this document in RStudio. If you have not done so already, make sure to install ``rmarkdown`` and ``knitr``. You can do this by clicking the Install button in the Packages tab in the lower-right corner of RStudio and following the directions on the installation menu. You can also install packages by entering ``install.packages(x)`` into the R Console, where ``x`` is the name of the package.

## Instructions
This assignment will cover the material from the first two class meetings. In addition, it will be an opportunity to further familiarize yourself with R, RStudio, and RMarkdown.

**Please begin by adding your name to the top of the document on line 3.** Instructions for how to submit the assignment are provided at the bottom on the document.

## Using RMarkdown
This RMarkdown document contains a mixture of text (formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) conventions) and R code "chunks". Each chunk begins with a set of braces containing important information. For example, the chunk below is prefaced with ``{r preliminaries, include=FALSE}``. First, the `r` signifies that the chunk should be run using R. Second, ``preliminaries`` is the name of the chunk. This is followed by a set of options, separated by commas. In this case ``include=FALSE`` means that this code chunk will not be shown in any output. If we set it to ``TRUE`` then the chunk would be printed in any output.

```{r preliminaries, include=FALSE} 
# No need for any code here
```

In the first cell (lines 9-24) there are also some global options that alter the behavior of all code chunks. Look at the documentation [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options).

You can execute the code in a chunk by clicking the green arrow in the top right ("Run Current Chunk") or by using the keyboard shortcut. You can also run individual lines by selecting the line or clicking at the beginning and using the keyboard shortcut.

``Alt + Shift + K`` or ``Option + Shift + K``, depending upon your computer, will open up a menu showing all keyboard shortcuts available in RStudio.

## A note on notation
The dollar symbol is used to indicate mathematical notation written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/), a typesetting language used for scientific documents. It is a particularly useful way for rendering mathematical notation. For example, $\frac{1}{2}$. I do not expect you to learn to use LaTeX for this course. If you hover your mouse between the dollar signs you can see how the LaTeX code will render in the final output. Longer expressions can be rendered on a new line by adding two dollar signs either side. For example,

$$\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^k(x_i-\bar{x})^2$$

The backtick symbol indicates a specific object or function in R, for example `rnorm` refers to a function. When you render this document at the end of the assignment you will see how this syntax modifies the output.

#  Questions
Please answer each of the following questions. Note that some questions require both code and written answers (search for `Answer` at the end to make sure you have not missed any written questions).

Q1. For each of the following chunk options, explain what they do in one sentence (refer to the documentation on line 42):

    a. echo: Your answers here
    b. warning:
    c. message:
    d. tidy:
    e. error:
    
Q2. Use the "Insert a new code chunk" button to insert a new chunk below this line. Add the same option as the previous chunk. Once you have created the chunk, create a random variable $x$ consisting of 100 draws from a standard normal distribution. Name the variable `x` using the assignment operator.

Your chunk goes here (delete this line after inserting)

Q3. The summation operator, represented by capital sigma, indicates a sum over a set of values. Use R to calculate the sum of `x` and store it as an object called `s`. Print the result using `print`.

*Note: The `#` symbol is used to comment within code chunks. Anything on the same line as this symbol will not run. It is used to indicate where you should add to the chunks below. Please remove this before proceeding.*
```{r q3, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Your answer here
```


Q4. In the chunk below, calculate the sample mean of `x` by using the sum `s` defined above. Use the assignment operator to store the mean value with a name of your choice. Compare your results to the result of the `mean` function to verify that your answer is correct.
```{r q4, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Your answer here
mean(x) # Run this line to verify your answer
```

In one sentence, discuss the observed sample mean and how it relates to the population quantity.
Answer: 

Q5. Let's use the mean to calculate the sample variance. Use the mean calculated in the previous step to do this. Recall the variance is the sum of the squared differences between each element and the mean.

Verify that your answer is correct by comparing to the built-in `var` function.
```{r q5, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Calculate variance here
var.x <- #
print(var.x) # verify your answer matches the one produced by the line below
print(var(x))
```

Q6. Use the `sqrt` function to calculate the standard deviation of `x` then answer the question below.
```{r q6, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Your code here
sd(x) # Use the sd function to verify your answer is correct
```

Why is the standard deviation often a more useful summary of a random variable than the variance?
Answer: 

Q7. The concept of the sampling distribution is central to frequentist statistics. The idea is that sample statistics are drawn from an underlying distribution. Use the `replicate` function to generate 1000 sample means from a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 2. Use the results to calculate the mean of the sampling distribution and its standard deviation (recall that the standard error is equivalent to the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.)
```{r q7, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
means <- replicate() # Complete the replicate function
mean.SD <- # Your code here
SE <- # Your code here
```

Q8. Use `ggplot` to create a simple histogram showing the sampling distribution created above. You will have to convert the vector of mean from Q7 into a `data.frame`. 
Add a vertical line to the plot showing the mean of the sampling distribution. 

*Hint: It might help by building the plot incrementally. Make a histogram then try to add the line. The plus signs are included to show you how to organize the code but you may need to comment some of them out for intermediate testing.*

Finally, answer the question below.
```{r q8, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
ggplot() + # Complete ggplot code
    + # Add histogram geom here
    + # Add vertical line geom here
```
Explain how this finding is related to the Central Limit Theorem.
Answer: 


Q9. We can use R to define functions to perform certain tasks. The following chunk contains two simple functions. The first returns the standard error of a given sample. The second use computes confidence intervals around a mean based on a chosen significance level. Observe how the `std.error` function is used by `conf.int`.

Use the `replicate` function to draw 100 observations from the population defined in Q7 and to calculate a confidence interval for each replication. The line of code below is used to convert the results into a data.frame. 

Use this data.frame to calculate how many confidence intervals *do not* contain the population mean. Hint: The mean is not contained in the interval if the lower bound is greater than the mean or the upper bound is less than the mean. Finally, answer the question below.
```{r q9, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Functions have been defined for you, do not edit.
std.error <- function(x) {
    return(sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)))
}

conf.int <- function(x, t=1.96) {
    se <- std.error(x)
    return(c(lower = mean(x)-t*se, upper = mean(x)+t*se))
}

reps <- replicate() # Complete the replicate function
CIs <- as.data.frame(t(reps)) # Converts the results to a data.frame, do not edit.
head(CIs) # Running this will show you how the CIs object is structuted

# How many CIs contain zero? Hint: Use `filter` to find the relevant subset of rows in CIs
```
What proportion of the confidence intervals calculated should we expect to contain the true population mean $\mu$? 

What would you expect to see if we modified the confidence interval to use `t` = 2.58? Why?

Q10. The code in the chunk below is used to create two variables, similar to the example in section 6.2 of GHV. In this case, `y` is a function of `x`, along with some noise drawn from a normal distribution. *Note that running this chunk will override the variable `x` created above.*

Create a `ggplot` to show the relationship between the two variables. Include the regression line and each of the points. Answer the question below.
```{r q10, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
x <- 1:30
n <- length(x)
B0 <- 0.3
B1 <- -0.2
sigma <- 1
y <- B0 + B1*x + sigma*rnorm(n)
df <- as.data.frame(x=x,y=y)

ggplot() + # Complete the ggplot function and add additional geom elements
```
What does the plot tell us about the relationship between the two variables?
Answer:

Q11. Use a linear model (`lm`) to estimate the relationship between `x` and `y` then present the output using `modelsummary`. Next, answer the questions below.

```{r q11, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Your code here
```
What does the model show about the relationship between `x` and `y`? 
Answer:

What does the R2 value indicate about the model?
Answer:

Q12. We can use the model above to predict the value of `y` for any value of `x`. Extract the relevant coefficients from the model and use them to predict the value of `y` when `x` is equal to `0` and `1` and `-1`. Show each calculation separately.

```{r q11, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Your code here
```

Q13. Finally, let's take a look at a regression using some real-world data. The following chunk is used to load data from two different sources. 

First, data from the MIT election lab is used to collect County Presidential Election returns 2000-2020 in the United States. You can read more about the dataset here: https://electionlab.mit.edu/data. This file is stored in the homework folder. 

Second, a dataset is directly downloaded from a Github repository belonging to the New York Times. It contains information of county-level estimates of mask used to prevent against COVID-19 from a survey conducted between July 2 and July 14 2020. You can read more about it here: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use

The two datasets are merged by joining on the country FIPS (Federal Information Processing System) code. Note that there are different numbers of rows in each dataset and there appears to be some missing data. For now we will focus on the common rows (counties where we have election and mask data). 

We will use these data to analyze the relationship between mask wearing and politics at the country-level using Trump support in the November 2020 election as a proxy.

Read the code carefully then proceed to the next code chunk. You may want to take a look at the two datasets in more detail.
```{r loading data, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
elections <- read_csv("countypres_2000-2020.csv") %>% 
    filter(year == 2020 & candidate == "DONALD J TRUMP" & mode == "TOTAL") %>%
    mutate(vote_share = candidatevotes / totalvotes) %>%
    select(state, county_fips, vote_share)

masks <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv")

data <- elections %>% 
    left_join(masks, by = c("county_fips" = "COUNTYFP")) %>%
    drop_na()
```

Using these data, estimate a linear model to predict how mask use varies by Trump support. You may use any one of the survey questions or combine them (e.g.`low_mask_wearing = NEVER + RARELY`). Store the model as an object called `results` then create a summary table using `modelsummary`.   Answer the question below.
```{r q13, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Your code here
```
What do the results of the model show about the relationship between country-level politics and mask wearing?
Answer:

Is the observed relationship statistically significant?
Answer:

Can you think of an explanation for this finding? Write a short paragraph. You can ground your answer in any relevant theories or just write something more general.
Answer: 

Are there any problems with the model or data that should be taken into account? Write a short paragraph considering the limitations of the current model.
